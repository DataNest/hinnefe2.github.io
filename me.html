I'm a physics grad student and aspiring data scientist.
<br>
<br>
I will (hopefully) graduate sometime this coming fall, at which point the 
plan is to move to Chicago and get a job in data science.
My research uses electrical transport data to investigate the electronic properties of novel materials. 
On the side, I explore public and web-scraped datasets and write up the results here.
On the other side, I play a bit of bluegrass fiddle.

If you're interested in hearing more about any of this, or if you want to collaborate on 
some data science side projects, please feel free to <a href='mailto:henry.hinnefeld@gmail.com'>get in touch</a>.
