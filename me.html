<br>
I'm a data scientist (read reformed physicist) living in Chicago.
<br>
<br>
In a past life I used electrical transport data to investigate the electronic properties of novel carbon-based materials. 
These days I use all kinds of data to study the behavior of carbon-based life forms.
On the side, I explore public and web-scraped datasets and write up the results here.
On the other side, I play a bit of bluegrass fiddle.
