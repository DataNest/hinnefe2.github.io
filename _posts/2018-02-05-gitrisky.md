Git is a powerful tool for code versioning. If you follow its best practices
and have good 'commit hygiene' (easier said than
[done](https://xkcd.com/1296/)) it can also be a source of valuable data about
your coding practices. A while back I built a little tool that uses the
metadata git collects, along with its logging and 'blaming' functionality to
score commits on their likelihood of introducing a bug. The code is open
sourced on github, [check it out](https://github.com/hinnefe2/gitrisky),  -- you
could even run the tool against it's own git history! I also gave a talk at
PyData NYC 2017 about how it works, linked below the fold.
