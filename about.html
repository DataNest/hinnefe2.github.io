<div class="about">
<br>
s/buy/make/ is a blog about making things, mostly out of data and code. 
<br>
<br>
The name comes from the syntax of the <i>sed</i> command line utility, 
in words it reads "replace instances of the word 'buy' with the word 'make'".
This is how I want to spend my time --
at the end of the day it's more fun and more rewarding to 
create something new than to consume something that someone else made.
