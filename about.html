<div class="about">
<br>
s/buy/make/ is a blog about making things. 
<br>
<br>
The name comes from the syntax of the <i>sed</i> command line utility, 
in words it reads "replace instances of the word 'buy' with the word 'make'".
This nicely summarizes how I feel about the way I want to spend my time:
at the end of the day it's more fun and more rewarding to 
create something new than to consume something that someone else made. 
I'm not arguing for making everything from scratch - the things I've made 
are almost always built on top of other people's work.
Hopefully other people can do the same with the things I've made here.
