<div class="about">
<br>
s/buy/make/ is a blog about making things. 
<br>
<br>
The basic premise is that at the end of the day it's more fun to 
create something new than to consume something that someone else made. 
It doesn't really matter what kind of thing we're talking about here,
the act of making is what's important.
